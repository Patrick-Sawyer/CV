I am a 36 year old who has spent the last 11 years working for Discovery Channel and Eurosport in a technical broadcasting role. I have spent the last 18 months learning to code, specifically JavaScript, Ruby, HTML & CSS. I get a lot of satisfaction from it and am now competant enough to make a career jump into development.

## Projects

www.disco-computer.com

I have a strong interest in making music so many of my projects utilise Web Audio API. The synth maybe a little esoteric, but you can load demo sounds and patterns using the dropdown. There is also a game here, which was my first experiment using OOP.

## Skills

#### Quick Learner

I have always learnt things quickly and easily, hence why I thought I would try my hand at coding. 

- The first project on my website (the Disco Computer drum machine) was completed only 2 months after "Hello World". In that time I learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript to a point I could make a fully functioning Web App.

#### Self starter. 

Prior to the Makers course, I was completely self taught. 

- I managed to make multiple functional Web Apps within a year of starting to learn HTML.

#### Works well under pressure.

- I have always enjoyed jobs that challenge me, and generally work best under pressure.
- 11 years working on the front line of multiple TV channels, including doing live sport.
