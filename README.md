- Git workflow
- TDD / BDD e.g. Jest / Cypress / RSpec

I have an app on Google Play which you can download for free. This is a DJ app built using React Native. Search for NoSync on Google Play.

I have also spent the last few months building a table booking app for a client, again using React Native. I was solely responsible for building the front end of an app (IOS/Android/Web). This will be live in a few weeks so you cannot download it just yet.

Some of my earlier projects can be found on my website disco-computer.com and github.com/Patrick-Sawyer.

I am also a graduate of the MAKERS intensive coding bootcamp. Here I was able to expand my skills and gain
invaluable experience working in teams. This was a web development course focussed on TDD, Ruby, Rails and React.

I have learnt many aspects of development vital to working on large scale projects such as test-driven development, object-oriented programming and git workflow. I am eager to learn more and am looking for work that utilises my current skillset whilst continually teaching me new technologies.

## Skills

#### Quick Learner

I have always learnt things quickly and easily, hence why I thought I would try my hand at coding. 

- The first project on my website (the Disco Computer drum machine) was completed only 2 months after "Hello World". In that time I learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript to a point I could make a fully functioning Web App.

#### Self starter. 

Prior to the Makers course, I was completely self taught. 

- I managed to make multiple functional Web Apps within a year of starting to learn HTML.

#### Works well under pressure.

- I have always enjoyed jobs that challenge me, and generally work best under pressure.
- 11 years working on the front line of multiple TV channels, including doing live sport.
